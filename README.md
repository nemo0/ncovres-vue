# ðŸŽž Project Details

nCovWB is an open-source project that helps find leads about covid related helplines and other information available in various districts of West Bengal, India.

# ðŸ¥‹ Motivation

A one-stop-shop like a resource center for a covid related database is not available in West Bengal. I faced issues when searching for leads for someone I know. It was challenging to find good leads. This project is a take on solving this problem.

# ðŸ›  Tech

For the frontend or this repo, **Vue 2** has been used. The backend is served from Sanity. The backend is hosted on _Sanity Studio_ and the frontend is hosted on _[Vercel](https://vercel.com/?utm_source=[nemo0]&utm_campaign=oss)_.

# âœ¨ Contribute

You can also contribute to the project if you abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nemo0/ncovres-vue/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# ðŸ¥‡ Credits

A huge thank you to [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/). The whole frontend is based on the Forty theme available there. Also, a big shoutout to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?utm_source=[nemo0]&utm_campaign=oss) and Sanity for providing hosting and the CMS.
This project is my first time working with Vue. A talk from [Vue BLR](https://blr.vue.community/) helped me a lot in getting started. Also, [Kishalay NGO](https://kishalay.org/) supported the cause and helped in every possible way.
